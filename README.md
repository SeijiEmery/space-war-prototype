# space-war-prototype

Just a quick prototype / demo for my game pitch.

Consists of one ship w/ direct movement and camera controls. Didn't get very far (the next step would be RTS controls, ship spawning, and ship-ship combat) cuz I spent my weekend at calhacks and basically ran out of time. Everything here was built in a day or so, basically.

If you want to run the demo, you need to get godot: https://godotengine.org

If you need help, check out the godot tutorial: http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/getting_started/step_by_step/intro_to_the_editor_interface.html

This is a godot project, so you just need to launch godot, open this directory / project, open `scenes/TestShipController.tscn`, and click play to launch (I think)

Oh, and you need a gamepad, cuz I just built the controls around that xD

Controls are LS to move the ship (note that it has a veeerrrry crappy turning radius; that was intentional), RS to aim the turrets, RT (R2) to fire. Pressing A (xbox) / X (dualshock) toggles into camera mode, where LS moves the camera and RS zooms in / out. Zooming is a bit broken â€“ I was gonna fix that but oh well.

Anyways that's the demo!

Feel free to hack on this if you want.

Many thanks to Skorpio on open game art for the assets: <https://opengameart.org/content/space-ship-construction-kit>
